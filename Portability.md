# Portability #

The program has been successfully tested on a number of Scheme interpreters and compilers, including Gambit v4.0, Bigloo 3.0, Chicken 2.6.

It should be portable to any Scheme interpreter or compiler supporting low-level, non-hygienic macros Ã  la define-macro. If you port `lalr-scm` to a new Scheme system and you want this port to be included in the next releases, please contact the maintainer.
